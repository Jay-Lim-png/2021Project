### Airbnb Marketing Process

- Find Objectives
    
    ‚Üí the Airbnb could make objective about how to improve customer experience
    
- Make Strategies
    - Segmentiation
        
        means categorizing customers based on standards: ex. travel purpose, price sensitivity
        
    - Targeting
        
        Looking at which segment to focus on
        
    - Positioning
        
        Î≠îÏÜåÎ¶∞ÏßÄ Î™®Î•¥Í≤üÎÑ§
        
- Strategic challenge of Airbnb
    - To find this, first understand how they make money (Airbnb case- makes guests and hosts come together and Airbnb charges both sides of the platform)
    
    ‚Üí Strategic challenge Airbnb Address: make the portal to be rented as soon as possible
    
- Find data generated on the website to address the strategic challenge

### Steps of Analytics Process

1. Build a Mental model : To identify the metric Airbnb is trying to maximize (metric: profit per property)
    - how mental model is used for the marketing process?
        - To outline the factors that influence the target metric
        - As a hypothesis to test the data
        - To target an intuitive sense of what is happening in the market
        - As the basis of predictive model
    
    In this case, profit Airbnb is trying to maximize is profit per property: obtained by multiplying gross margin .. This consists of property price(the company charge for), number of rentals, minimum stay etc
    
    (1) Find what target(Customer) influence
    
    In this case, numbers of rentals
    
    (2) Find how customers pick their rental place : ITC, other customers‚Äô reviews
    
    (3) Find out contributors to the rental number to build a predictive model
    
    ex) Review data‚Üí Use text analytics. Change raw data with grammar mistakes into review sentiment. **review_sentiment** is something makes text data into numbers (like scores)
    
    (4) Make final predictive model (Regression) and analyze the influences of contributors
    
    Airbnb look into contributors to find out which contributors influence the most for different kinds of groups
    
     
    

### Descriptive Analytics

Looking at historic information and Summarizing the past information

ex) In Airbnb Case, it‚Äôs about reports how often a property is rented, in which place, and why and what are happening in terms of some abnormalities.
