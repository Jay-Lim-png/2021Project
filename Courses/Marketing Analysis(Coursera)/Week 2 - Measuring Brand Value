## Brand Architecture

### Brand Value

with the example of Snapple

Snapple was first distributed through mom-and-pop stores. It has 52 flavors. With it’s personified brand, Snapple’s growth started straight around 1988.

Quaker(which owned Gatorade) bought Snapple and destroyed the brand value (1.4 Billion of value) It’s the example of misunderstanding what a brand means to the consumer.

- Y&R measure provides a diagnostic estimate

### Revenue Premium as a measure of Brand Equity

- Revenue premium : A brand earns in a market over a private label
- Equity = {[Revenue Premium - Additional Variable Cost] * [1+d]} / [1+d-r]
    - [1+d] / [1+d-r] = long term multiplier(장기승수)
    - r = stabling factor(portion of equity retained from period to period) - it’s about whether the brand is stable to get cash
    - d = discount rate
    
    So if the brand is stable, the equity increases as the long term multiplier increases
    

### How to calculate Brand Equity? (example of Snapple)

|  | Brand | Share | Price/Pound | Pounds/HH (amount of hh buys annually) |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| 1994 | Private Label (with no brand) | 9.9 | .24 | 4.6 |
| 1994 | Snapple | 25.1 | .75 | 4.6 |
1. Annual Revenue Premium per household
    1. Revenue share of Snapple
        
        : (Share per one pound) * (Price per one pound) = .251 * .75
        
    2. Revenue share of Private Label
        
        : (Share per one pound) * (Price per one pound) = .099 * .24
        
    3. Final Annual Revenue Premium/HH 
        
        : [(.251 * .75) - (.099 * .24)] (4.6) = $0.76
        
2. Additional Variable Cost
    
    (Assume the margin of Private Label is 20 percent)
    
    [.251 - .099] ← difference between the shares
    
    [.251 - .099](.8)(.24)(4.6)  = $.13   (.8) ←(1- margin)
    
3. Annual Brand Equity
    
    (Assuming 100M HHs in US)
    
    (.76 - .13) * 100M = $63 million

![Untitled](Week%202%20-%20B%209c647/Untitled%202.png)

My answer

IncYour brand has already established differentiated and relevant products, but not many consumers may know about the brand or hold it in great esteem

**What is the fundamental premise of the revenue premium method as a measure of brand equity?**

My answer

A branded product has higher consumption per household than an unbranded product to account for the brand value.

The revenue premium as a measure of brand equity does not make any assumptions about differences in consumption per household between branded and unbranded products.
