## Week 1 Course Content

### Definition & Essential Characteristics of Cloud Computing

1. On-Demand Self Service
    
    get access to cloud resource(power, storage, network etc) without requiring human interaction
    
2. Broad Network Access
    
    get access through standard mechanisms and broad kinds of platforms
    
3. Resource Pooling
    
    Economies of scale (for cloud providers) b.c computer resouces are provided on demand (more users, more efficient)
    
4. Rapid Elasticity
    
    Use it when you need them
    
5. Measured Service
    
    Pay as much as you use
    

### Deployment models

1. Public
    
    leverage cloud services over the open internet on hardware owned by the cloud computer but its usage is shared by other companies
    
2. Private
    
    the infrastructure is provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization. run on on-premises or owned,managed by a service provider.
    
3. Hybrid
    
    mix of the former two models
    

### Service models

1. IaaS(Infrastructure)
    
    Provide Infrastructure and physical computing resources such as servers, networking, storage, and data center space
    
2. Paas(Platform)
    
    Provide platform such as hardware and software tools need to develop and deploy applications
    
3. SaaS(Application) 
    
    Software licensing model. Normally licensed on a subscription basis
    

### History and Evolution of Cloud Computing

1. VMs : multiple distinct compute environments on the same physical hardware(Virtualization).  (Hypervisor - software layer that enables multiple operating system to run alongside each other, sharing the same physical computing resources, Slicing Virtual Machines each other) By hypervisor, even if one VM break down, the others can run safely
2. Cloud : Switch from CapEx to OpEx
    
    Capital Expense have high up-front costs but Operating Expense costs nothing or low up-front costs
    

### Key Considerations and Cloud Computing

1. Cost efficiency (Low initial costs, pay-as-you-go, no workload to managing the system)
2. Lower Risk Exposure (investing a new HW or SW might be dangerous)
3. Saving time to develop new platform

Week1 was basically a viral for IBM Cloud Service...

****1.질문 1**

Which cloud deployment model lets users use multiple cloud models working together seamlessly?
**Hybrid**

**맞습니다**

Hybrid model is the mix of both public and private clouds working together seamlessly.

****2.질문 2**

What 1950s technology helped evolve to Virtual Machines (VMs)?
**Shared access of a mainframe**

**맞습니다**

Time sharing or resource pooling allowed multiple users were able to access the same data storage layer and CPU power on mainframes, using dumb terminals.
