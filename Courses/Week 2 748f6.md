### Overview of Cloud Service Models

Three types of service models

- IaaS(Infrastructure)
    
    The Cloud provider managers physical computing resources such as data centers, cooling, power, networking & security, servers & storage.
    
- PaaS(Platform)
    
    Computer resources + Operating Systems(OS) + Development tools + Databases + Business Analytics
    
- SaaS(Application)
    
    Former two service + Data + Application
    

## Service Models

### Infrastructure as a service

- Deliver compute, network, storage to consumers on-demand, over the internet, on a pay-as-you-go basis
- Customers can create VMs and develop middleware, applications, and data on this VMs & create storage for workloads and backups
- Provide ability to track and monitor the performance
- Fundamental elements: Physical data centers, Compute memory storage), Network(get access to network resources through virtualization or APIs), Storage(Three types - object/file/block)
    - Object storage: most common mode of storage. highly distributed and resilient
- IaaS usecases
    - test and development : enable their team to set up test and development environments faster (don‚Äôt need to spend time on managing infrastructure)
    - Business continuity and disaster recovery
    - Faster deployments and scaling: deploy application faster, scale up as demands fluctuates
    - High performance computing: to solve complex calculations which needs high computer resources
    - Big data analysis: huge amount of processing power
- Concerns
    
    Lack of transparency, dependency on a third party
    

### Platform as a service

- Host and manage installation, configuration, operation of application infrastructure such as servers, networks, storage, operating system, application runtimes, api, middleware, databases

![Ïä§ÌÅ¨Î¶∞ÏÉ∑ 2022-03-10 Ïò§Ï†Ñ 12.33.23.png](Week%202%20748f6/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7_2022-03-10_%EC%98%A4%EC%A0%84_12.33.23.png)

- Essential characteristics of PaaS
    - provide high level of abstraction (eliminate complexity of deploying app)
    - support services and api (simplify job of developers)
    - run-time environments (execute code according to app owner and cloud provider policies)
    - rapid deployment mechanism
    - middleware capabilities (support a range of app infrastructure or middleware capabilities such as app servers, db management systems, BA capabilities, mobile back-end services, integration services, business process management systems, rule engines and complex event processing systems) - reducing time for write codes to expand the service
- Use Cases
    - API development and management
    - IoT deployment
    - Business analytics/intelligence
    - Business Process Management(BPM)
    - Master data management (MDM) : save critical business data to a single point of reference
- Advantages of PaaS
    - scalability
    - faster time to market (Apis, support services, and middleware capabilities reduce the amount of code)
    - greater agility and innovation (provide chance to try new OS, languages with low cost)
- Examples of PaaS
    
    AWS Elastic Beanstalk, CloudFoundry, IBM Cloud Paks, Azure Windows, Openshift, Magento, force.com, Apache Stratos
    
- Risks of PaaS
    
    Information security threats, Dependency on service provider, Customers lack control over changes in service offerings or tools
    

### Software as a service

- Providers maintain servers, databases, application code, security that constitutes the service and manage app security, availability and performance.
- Ensure every user has access to the same, centrally located, infrastructure and application code
- Examples of Saas
    - Email and collaboration : Google gmail, Microsoft Office 365
    - Customer Relationship management: NetSuite CRM, Salesforce
    - HR management: Workday, SAP SuccessFactors
    - Financial Management
    - Saas overtaken on-premises solution in HCM and CRM
- Multitenant architecture, Manage privileges and monitor data, security, Compliance, Maintenance, Customize application, subscription model, scalable resources
- Key Benefits
    - Reduce the time from decision to value
    - Increase workforce productivity and efficiency
    - Small enterprises can spread out software costs over time
- Concerns
    - Data ownership and data safety
    - Third party maintains business-critical data
    - Relies on good internet connection

## Deployment Models

Deployment models indicate where the infrastructure resides, who owns and manages it and how cloud resources and services are made available to users.

### Public Cloud

- Users don‚Äôt own the servers or even determine how the platform are maintained
- Users can save money (b.c they don‚Äôt manage any of the infrastructure and facilities) but subject to the performance and security of the cloud provider
- Any cloud users can access the resources
- ex) AWS, Azure, IBM Cloud, Google Cloud, Alibaba Cloud providing servers, storage, network, security, databases
- Concerns
    - Security, Data sovereignty(Ï£ºÍ∂å) compliance(Î≥ÄÌòïÌïòÍ∏∞ Ïâ¨Ïö¥ Ï†ïÎèÑ)

### Private Cloud

- Provisioned for exclusive use by a single organization comprising multiple consumers like the business units within the organization.
- on premises(Internal Infrastructure) or off premises(External Infrastructure)
- Virtual Private Cloud(VPC)
    
    Isolated part of public cloud so that the customer can manage the infrastructure and secure tailored to the organization‚Äôs unique needs
    

![Ïä§ÌÅ¨Î¶∞ÏÉ∑ 2022-03-10 Ïò§Ï†Ñ 1.55.43.png](Week%202%20748f6/%EC%8A%A4%ED%81%AC%EB%A6%B0%EC%83%B7_2022-03-10_%EC%98%A4%EC%A0%84_1.55.43.png)

- Private Cloud also have the same benefits of public cloud (compared to the total on-premise environment)
- Use Cases
    - Modernize and unify in-house & legacy applications
    - Integrate data & application services from existing applications
    - Build app anywhere & move them without compromising security or compliance
    - Full control over critical security & compliance issues within dedicated cloud

### Hybrid Cloud

- Connects an organizations‚Äô on-premise private cloud and third-party public cloud
- Sensitive or regulated applications, constant workloads on private cloud + Less sensitive and more dynamic workloads on public cloud
- Three tenets of hybrid cloud
    - Interoperable: private & public clouds can understand each other‚Äôs APIs, configuration, data formats, authentication & authorization
    - Scalable: private cloud can leverage public cloud capacity
    - Portable: Move app&data between on-premise and cloud
- Types of of hybrid clouds
    - Hybrid Monocloud : one cloud provider
    - Hybrid multicloud: can be deployed on any public cloud infrastructure
    - Composite multicloud: greater flexibility
- Benefits
    - Security and compliance
    - Scalabilty and resilience
    - Resource optimization
    - Cost-saving: Customers are not locked-in with a specific vender thus they can chose the most cost-efficient choice
- Use Cases
    - Software as a service integration
    - Data & AI integration
    - Enhancing legacy apps
    - VMware migration
    

### Ïò§ÎãµÎÖ∏Ìä∏

Which of these statements is a characteristic of Public Clouds?

1. Resources are assigned as per estimated need decided at the time of subscribing for the service
2. The cloud provider provisions the resources and services as needed by individual users
3. A public cloud provides a dedicated pool of resources to each of its multiple users (wrong - cloud provider‚Äôs pool is not dedicated for use by a single tenant)
4. A public cloud is a virtualized multi-tenant architecture

Which of these statements are true of Virtual Private Clouds (VPCs)? *Select two.*

1. VPCs may be provisioned over a cloud service provider‚Äôs infrastructure, but the infrastructure is owned, managed, and operated by the enterprise
2. VPC allows all users of the shared public cloud to access resources in the VPC on need basis; it also allows users of the VPC to access resources of the public cloud (X)
    
    ‚Üí Public Cloud users cannot access the instances of the VPC
    
3. VPCs are provisioned in a logically isolated part of a shared public cloud (O)
4. The VPC infrastructure is owned, managed, and operated by the public cloud service provider
